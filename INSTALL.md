This project builds with RGBDS 0.2.4.

# Linux

Linux dependencies. OSX users already have these after installing Xcode.

	sudo apt-get install make gcc bison git python python-setuptools


Set up the **pokered** repository:

	git clone git://github.com/iimarckus/pokered.git
	cd pokered

	sudo ./init.sh


Now **pokered.gbc** can be built from source.

	make red

This should take about 10-15 seconds. Subsequent builds are faster.


To build Pok√©mon Blue:

	make blue


# OSX

Download and install **Xcode**. Then follow the Linux instructions.


# Windows
